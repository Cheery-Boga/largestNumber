// prompt user for three numbers;
// create a variable for each number (num1, num2 and num3);
// if (num1 > num2) && (num1 > num3) - then num1 is the largest;
// else if (num2 > num3) then number 2 is the largest;
// else num3 is the largest;

We asked the user, via a prompt, to give us three numbers. We then created a function to determine which is the largest of the three numbers provided.
